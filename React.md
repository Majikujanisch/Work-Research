# React

## Code Splitting

 One huge aspect of React and NextJS is Code Splitting. This happens through many ways, one are React.Components subclasses. These look like this:
``` jsx
class ShoppingList extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <div className="shopping-list">
        <h1>Shopping List for {this.props.name}</h1>
        <ul>
          <li>Instagram</li>
          <li>WhatsApp</li>
          <li>Oculus</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
    );
  }
}
```
They are used to change data, react then will efficiantly update and re-render the components. They take in parameters called props or properties and return a hierarchy of views to display via the render method.

In order to keep everything clean many use JSX Syntax and with that you can write the Component above like this:
```jsx
return React.createElement('div', {className: 'shopping-list'},
  React.createElement('h1',  null, "Shopping List for ", props.name),
  React.createElement('ul', null, 
  React.createElement("li", null, "Instagram"), 
  React.createElement("li", null, "WhatsApp"), 
  React.createElement("li", null, "Oculus"))
);
```
The ShoppingList can now be called like any other HTML attribute which makes making UIs easier by using small components.

To use the props of a component you use {this.props.value}.

For a component to remember something, they use state. These can be set in the constructor of a component like this:
```jsx
class Square extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = {
      value: null,
    };
  }

  render() {
    return (
      <button className="square" onClick={() => console.log('click')}>
        {this.props.value}
      </button>
    );
  }
}
```

If its hard to follow the component tree logic you can install the react Devtools extension for chromium and firefox.[link](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/react-developer-tools/fmkadmapgofadopljbjfkapdkoienihi?hl=en)

## Function Components

In Case a class takes only props and has no state, it can be written as a function as following:
```jsx
function Square(props) {
  return (
    <button className="square" onClick={props.onClick}>
      {props.value}
    </button>
  );
}
```
This way I built most of the App, which is on [this](https://git.intra.uibk.ac.at/c102371/webseitestudioansteuerung) Repo, documentation can be found [here](ReactAppReadMe.md)

# NextJS

## basic datastructure
Most NextJS have da datastructure similar to this:
- pages (All pages that should be routable (except api, these sites will not be bundeled into the clientsided build))
  - admin 
    - index.js (https://localhost:port/admin)
  - api
    - apihandler, etc
  - index.js (https://localhost:port/)
- public (static content like Pictures)
- styles (for CSS)
  - globals.css 
  - indexside.module.css (For each page a own module can be created)
- components 

## Data Fetching
NextJs has 4 different prebuilt ways to get props:
 - GetServerSideProps (HTML generated at request)
 - GetStaticProps (HTML generated at Build, reused on request)
 - incremental Stativ Regenartion (Reload of the Page with revalidate)
 - Client Side Fetching with useEffect

## Navigation
For Navigation NextJs uses the Link Component exported from next/link
example:
```jsx
import Link from 'next/link'

function Home() {
  return (
    <ul>
      <li>
        <Link href="/">
          <a>Home</a>
        </Link>
      </li>
      <li>
        <Link href="/about">
          <a>About Us</a>
        </Link>
      </li>
      <li>
        <Link href="/blog/hello-world">
          <a>Blog Post</a>
        </Link>
      </li>
    </ul>
  )
}

export default Home
```

## Dev vs Production
NextJs can be run in Dev or in a production built. The basic difference is following:
- getStaticProps gets loaded on every request (Dev)
- getStaticProps gets loaded once on built

## Authentification
As we also wanted Users to be able to access the side and block out everyone with no access we will need an Authentification service. Possible hooks would have been:
- Supertoken -> lots of guides
- Clerk -> SelfService inbuilt
- Ory Kratos -> Recovery, AdminApi, Selfservice via module, different identity Schemes possible, Activation via Admin possible.
