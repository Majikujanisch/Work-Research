# Developing flows
## Flow Structure
As you go Flows (The single pages) will grow and get uncontrollable, to prevent this there are some key rules to follow and advises to follow.

### Splitting flows
don't just paste all nodes into one single Flow, if there are some logical seperations that can be made, do em in different flows eg. All Flows for one room into one flow or all translations of statuses in one flow. So you always know where to look if something does not work in a spec room or with a spec. Status-output.

### Reusable Flows
As you go u will notice that some Node-Combi are always the same, in such cases you can use SubFlows.
Another way of making reusable Flows are the Link-Nodes, these can link two different flows together like they are one Flow.
What are the differences?
| Link Node | Header Two     |
| :------------- | :------------- |
| Item One       | Item Two       |
